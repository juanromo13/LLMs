Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2\\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1\\nEncoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:\\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2\\nAttention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\\nattention layers running in parallel.\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof\\n1\\n√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by\\n1\\n√dk .\\n3.2.2\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = Pdk\\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\\n4\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\nMultiHead(Q, K, V ) = Concat(head1, ..., headh)W O\\nwhere headi = Attention(QW Q\\ni , KW K\\ni , V W V\\ni )\\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W Q\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W K\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W V\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dv\\nand W O ∈Rhdv×dmodel.\\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5\\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\\nfor different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel\\nsize of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type\\nComplexity per Layer\\nSequential\\nMaximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention\\nO(n2 · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(1)\\nRecurrent\\nO(n · d2)\\nO(n)\\nO(n)\\nConvolutional\\nO(k · n · d2)\\nO(1)\\nO(logk(n))\\nSelf-Attention (restricted)\\nO(r · n · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(n/r)\\n3.5\\nPositional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nPE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5\\nTraining\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1\\nTraining Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2\\nHardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3\\nOptimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)\\n(3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4\\nRegularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7\\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\\nModel\\nBLEU\\nTraining Cost (FLOPs)\\nEN-DE\\nEN-FR\\nEN-DE\\nEN-FR\\nByteNet [18]\\n23.75\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [39]\\n39.2\\n1.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL [38]\\n24.6\\n39.92\\n2.3 · 1019\\n1.4 · 1020\\nConvS2S [9]\\n25.16\\n40.46\\n9.6 · 1018\\n1.5 · 1020\\nMoE [32]\\n26.03\\n40.56\\n2.0 · 1019\\n1.2 · 1020\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39]\\n40.4\\n8.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [38]\\n26.30\\n41.16\\n1.8 · 1020\\n1.1 · 1021\\nConvS2S Ensemble [9]\\n26.36\\n41.29\\n7.7 · 1019\\n1.2 · 1021\\nTransformer (base model)\\n27.3\\n38.1\\n3.3 · 1018\\nTransformer (big)\\n28.4\\n41.8\\n2.3 · 1019\\nResidual Dropout\\nWe apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\nLabel Smoothing\\nDuring training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls = 0.1 [36]. This\\nhurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\\n6\\nResults\\n6.1\\nMachine Translation\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)\\nin Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0\\nBLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature.

As a re-\\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne-\\ntuned with just one additional output layer\\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\\nspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.\\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\\npowerful.\\nIt obtains new state-of-the-art re-\\nsults on eleven natural language processing\\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\\nbe effective for improving many natural language\\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\\nwhere models are required to produce ﬁne-grained\\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\\nThere are two existing strategies for apply-\\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\\nstream tasks: feature-based and ﬁne-tuning. The\\nfeature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters\\net al., 2018a), uses task-speciﬁc architectures that\\ninclude the pre-trained representations as addi-\\ntional features. The ﬁne-tuning approach, such as\\nthe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI\\nGPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal\\ntask-speciﬁc parameters, and is trained on the\\ndownstream tasks by simply ﬁne-tuning all pre-\\ntrained parameters. The two approaches share the\\nsame objective function during pre-training, where\\nthey use unidirectional language models to learn\\ngeneral language representations.\\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the\\npower of the pre-trained representations, espe-\\ncially for the ﬁne-tuning approaches.\\nThe ma-\\njor limitation is that standard language models are\\nunidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi-\\ntectures that can be used during pre-training. For\\nexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-\\nright architecture, where every token can only at-\\ntend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers\\nof the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re-\\nstrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,\\nand could be very harmful when applying ﬁne-\\ntuning based approaches to token-level tasks such\\nas question answering, where it is crucial to incor-\\nporate context from both directions.\\nIn this paper, we improve the ﬁne-tuning based\\napproaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional\\nEncoder\\nRepresentations\\nfrom\\nTransformers.\\nBERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi-\\nrectionality constraint by using a “masked lan-\\nguage model” (MLM) pre-training objective, in-\\nspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953).\\nThe\\nmasked language model randomly masks some of\\nthe tokens from the input, and the objective is to\\npredict the original vocabulary id of the masked\\narXiv:1810.04805v2  [cs.CL]  24 May 2019\\nword based only on its context.\\nUnlike left-to-\\nright language model pre-training, the MLM ob-\\njective enables the representation to fuse the left\\nand the right context, which allows us to pre-\\ntrain a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addi-\\ntion to the masked language model, we also use\\na “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pre-\\ntrains text-pair representations. The contributions\\nof our paper are as follows:\\n• We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional\\npre-training for language representations. Un-\\nlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec-\\ntional language models for pre-training, BERT\\nuses masked language models to enable pre-\\ntrained deep bidirectional representations. This\\nis also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which\\nuses a shallow concatenation of independently\\ntrained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\\n• We show that pre-trained representations reduce\\nthe need for many heavily-engineered task-\\nspeciﬁc architectures. BERT is the ﬁrst ﬁne-\\ntuning based representation model that achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance on a large suite\\nof sentence-level and token-level tasks, outper-\\nforming many task-speciﬁc architectures.\\n• BERT advances the state of the art for eleven\\nNLP tasks.\\nThe code and pre-trained mod-\\nels are available at https://github.com/\\ngoogle-research/bert.\\n2\\nRelated Work\\nThere is a long history of pre-training general lan-\\nguage representations, and we brieﬂy review the\\nmost widely-used approaches in this section.\\n2.1\\nUnsupervised Feature-based Approaches\\nLearning widely applicable representations of\\nwords has been an active area of research for\\ndecades, including non-neural (Brown et al., 1992;\\nAndo and Zhang, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006) and\\nneural (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al.,\\n2014) methods.\\nPre-trained word embeddings\\nare an integral part of modern NLP systems, of-\\nfering signiﬁcant improvements over embeddings\\nlearned from scratch (Turian et al., 2010). To pre-\\ntrain word embedding vectors, left-to-right lan-\\nguage modeling objectives have been used (Mnih\\nand Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to dis-\\ncriminate correct from incorrect words in left and\\nright context (Mikolov et al., 2013).\\nThese approaches have been generalized to\\ncoarser granularities, such as sentence embed-\\ndings (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran and Lee,\\n2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov,\\n2014).\\nTo train sentence representations, prior\\nwork has used objectives to rank candidate next\\nsentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and\\nLee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sen-\\ntence words given a representation of the previous\\nsentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising auto-\\nencoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016).\\nELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017,\\n2018a) generalize traditional word embedding re-\\nsearch along a different dimension. They extract\\ncontext-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a\\nright-to-left language model. The contextual rep-\\nresentation of each token is the concatenation of\\nthe left-to-right and right-to-left representations.\\nWhen integrating contextual word embeddings\\nwith existing task-speciﬁc architectures, ELMo\\nadvances the state of the art for several major NLP\\nbenchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including ques-\\ntion answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment\\nanalysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity\\nrecognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder,\\n2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning\\ncontextual representations through a task to pre-\\ndict a single word from both left and right context\\nusing LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is\\nfeature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus\\net al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used\\nto improve the robustness of text generation mod-\\nels.\\n2.2\\nUnsupervised Fine-tuning Approaches\\nAs with the feature-based approaches, the ﬁrst\\nworks in this direction only pre-trained word em-\\nbedding parameters from unlabeled text\\n(Col-\\nlobert and Weston, 2008).\\nMore recently, sentence or document encoders\\nwhich produce contextual token representations\\nhave been pre-trained from unlabeled text and\\nﬁne-tuned for a supervised downstream task (Dai\\nand Le, 2015; Howard and Ruder, 2018; Radford\\net al., 2018). The advantage of these approaches\\nis that few parameters need to be learned from\\nscratch.\\nAt least partly due to this advantage,\\nOpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018) achieved pre-\\nviously state-of-the-art results on many sentence-\\nlevel tasks from the GLUE benchmark (Wang\\net al., 2018a).\\nLeft-to-right language model-\\nBERT\\nBERT\\nE[CLS]\\nE1\\n E[SEP]\\n...\\nEN\\nE1’\\n...\\nEM’\\nC\\nT1\\nT[SEP]\\n...\\nTN\\nT1’\\n...\\nTM’\\n[CLS]\\nTok 1\\n [SEP]\\n...\\nTok N\\nTok 1\\n...\\nTokM\\nQuestion\\nParagraph\\nStart/End Span\\nBERT\\nE[CLS]\\nE1\\n E[SEP]\\n...\\nEN\\nE1’\\n...\\nEM’\\nC\\nT1\\nT[SEP]\\n...\\nTN\\nT1’\\n...\\nTM’\\n[CLS]\\nTok 1\\n [SEP]\\n...\\nTok N\\nTok 1\\n...\\nTokM\\nMasked Sentence A\\nMasked Sentence B\\nPre-training\\nFine-Tuning\\nNSP\\nMask LM\\nMask LM\\nUnlabeled Sentence A and B Pair \\nSQuAD\\nQuestion Answer Pair\\nNER\\nMNLI\\nFigure 1: Overall pre-training and ﬁne-tuning procedures for BERT. Apart from output layers, the same architec-\\ntures are used in both pre-training and ﬁne-tuning. The same pre-trained model parameters are used to initialize\\nmodels for different down-stream tasks. During ﬁne-tuning, all parameters are ﬁne-tuned. [CLS] is a special\\nsymbol added in front of every input example, and [SEP] is a special separator token (e.g. separating ques-\\ntions/answers).\\ning and auto-encoder objectives have been used\\nfor pre-training such models (Howard and Ruder,\\n2018; Radford et al., 2018; Dai and Le, 2015).\\n2.3\\nTransfer Learning from Supervised Data\\nThere has also been work showing effective trans-\\nfer from supervised tasks with large datasets, such\\nas natural language inference (Conneau et al.,\\n2017) and machine translation (McCann et al.,\\n2017). Computer vision research has also demon-\\nstrated the importance of transfer learning from\\nlarge pre-trained models, where an effective recipe\\nis to ﬁne-tune models pre-trained with Ima-\\ngeNet (Deng et al., 2009; Yosinski et al., 2014).\\n3\\nBERT\\nWe introduce BERT and its detailed implementa-\\ntion in this section. There are two steps in our\\nframework: pre-training and ﬁne-tuning.\\nDur-\\ning pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\\ndata over different pre-training tasks.\\nFor ﬁne-\\ntuning, the BERT model is ﬁrst initialized with\\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\\neters are ﬁne-tuned using labeled data from the\\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep-\\narate ﬁne-tuned models, even though they are ini-\\ntialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\\nas a running example for this section.\\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its uniﬁed ar-\\nchitecture across different tasks. There is mini-\\nmal difference between the pre-trained architec-\\nture and the ﬁnal downstream architecture.\\nModel Architecture\\nBERT’s model architec-\\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\\nscribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\\nthe tensor2tensor library.1 Because the use\\nof Transformers has become common and our im-\\nplementation is almost identical to the original,\\nwe will omit an exhaustive background descrip-\\ntion of the model architecture and refer readers to\\nVaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides\\nsuch as “The Annotated Transformer.”2\\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers\\n(i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as\\nH, and the number of self-attention heads as A.3\\nWe primarily report results on two model sizes:\\nBERTBASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param-\\neters=110M) and BERTLARGE (L=24, H=1024,\\nA=16, Total Parameters=340M).\\nBERTBASE was chosen to have the same model\\nsize as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes.\\nCritically, however, the BERT Transformer uses\\nbidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Trans-\\nformer uses constrained self-attention where every\\ntoken can only attend to context to its left.4\\n1https://github.com/tensorﬂow/tensor2tensor\\n2http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html\\n3In all cases we set the feed-forward/ﬁlter size to be 4H,\\ni.e., 3072 for the H = 768 and 4096 for the H = 1024.\\n4We note that in the literature the bidirectional Trans-\\nInput/Output Representations\\nTo make BERT\\nhandle a variety of down-stream tasks, our input\\nrepresentation is able to unambiguously represent\\nboth a single sentence and a pair of sentences\\n(e.g., ⟨Question, Answer ⟩) in one token sequence.\\nThroughout this work, a “sentence” can be an arbi-\\ntrary span of contiguous text, rather than an actual\\nlinguistic sentence. A “sequence” refers to the in-\\nput token sequence to BERT, which may be a sin-\\ngle sentence or two sentences packed together.\\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,\\n2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The ﬁrst\\ntoken of every sequence is always a special clas-\\nsiﬁcation token ([CLS]). The ﬁnal hidden state\\ncorresponding to this token is used as the ag-\\ngregate sequence representation for classiﬁcation\\ntasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a\\nsingle sequence. We differentiate the sentences in\\ntwo ways. First, we separate them with a special\\ntoken ([SEP]). Second, we add a learned embed-\\nding to every token indicating whether it belongs\\nto sentence A or sentence B. As shown in Figure 1,\\nwe denote input embedding as E, the ﬁnal hidden\\nvector of the special [CLS] token as C ∈RH,\\nand the ﬁnal hidden vector for the ith input token\\nas Ti ∈RH.\\nFor a given token, its input representation is\\nconstructed by summing the corresponding token,\\nsegment, and position embeddings. A visualiza-\\ntion of this construction can be seen in Figure 2.\\n3.1\\nPre-training BERT\\nUnlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al.\\n(2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or\\nright-to-left language models to pre-train BERT.\\nInstead, we pre-train BERT using two unsuper-\\nvised tasks, described in this section. This step\\nis presented in the left part of Figure 1.\\nTask #1: Masked LM\\nIntuitively, it is reason-\\nable to believe that a deep bidirectional model is\\nstrictly more powerful than either a left-to-right\\nmodel or the shallow concatenation of a left-to-\\nright and a right-to-left model.\\nUnfortunately,\\nstandard conditional language models can only be\\ntrained left-to-right or right-to-left, since bidirec-\\ntional conditioning would allow each word to in-\\ndirectly “see itself”, and the model could trivially\\npredict the target word in a multi-layered context.\\nformer is often referred to as a “Transformer encoder” while\\nthe left-context-only version is referred to as a “Transformer\\ndecoder” since it can be used for text generation.\\nIn order to train a deep bidirectional representa-\\ntion, we simply mask some percentage of the input\\ntokens at random, and then predict those masked\\ntokens. We refer to this procedure as a “masked\\nLM” (MLM), although it is often referred to as a\\nCloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this\\ncase, the ﬁnal hidden vectors corresponding to the\\nmask tokens are fed into an output softmax over\\nthe vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our\\nexperiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece to-\\nkens in each sequence at random. In contrast to\\ndenoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we\\nonly predict the masked words rather than recon-\\nstructing the entire input.\\nAlthough this allows us to obtain a bidirec-\\ntional pre-trained model, a downside is that we\\nare creating a mismatch between pre-training and\\nﬁne-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not ap-\\npear during ﬁne-tuning. To mitigate this, we do\\nnot always replace “masked” words with the ac-\\ntual [MASK] token. The training data generator\\nchooses 15% of the token positions at random for\\nprediction. If the i-th token is chosen, we replace\\nthe i-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of\\nthe time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3)\\nthe unchanged i-th token 10% of the time. Then,\\nTi will be used to predict the original token with\\ncross entropy loss. We compare variations of this\\nprocedure in Appendix C.2.\\nTask #2:\\nNext Sentence Prediction (NSP)\\nMany important downstream tasks such as Ques-\\ntion Answering (QA) and Natural Language Infer-\\nence (NLI) are based on understanding the rela-\\ntionship between two sentences, which is not di-\\nrectly captured by language modeling. In order\\nto train a model that understands sentence rela-\\ntionships, we pre-train for a binarized next sen-\\ntence prediction task that can be trivially gener-\\nated from any monolingual corpus. Speciﬁcally,\\nwhen choosing the sentences A and B for each pre-\\ntraining example, 50% of the time B is the actual\\nnext sentence that follows A (labeled as IsNext),\\nand 50% of the time it is a random sentence from\\nthe corpus (labeled as NotNext).\\nAs we show\\nin Figure 1, C is used for next sentence predic-\\ntion (NSP).5 Despite its simplicity, we demon-\\nstrate in Section 5.1 that pre-training towards this\\ntask is very beneﬁcial to both QA and NLI. 6\\n5The ﬁnal model achieves 97%-98% accuracy on NSP.\\n6The vector C is not a meaningful sentence representation\\nwithout ﬁne-tuning, since it was trained with NSP.\\n[CLS]\\nhe\\nlikes\\nplay\\n##ing\\n[SEP]\\nmy\\ndog\\nis\\ncute\\n[SEP]\\nInput\\nE[CLS]\\nEhe\\nElikes\\nEplay\\nE##ing\\nE[SEP]\\nEmy\\nEdog\\nEis\\nEcute\\nE[SEP]\\nToken\\nEmbeddings\\nEA\\nEB\\nEB\\nEB\\nEB\\nEB\\nEA\\nEA\\nEA\\nEA\\nEA\\nSegment\\nEmbeddings\\nE0\\nE6\\nE7\\nE8\\nE9\\nE10\\nE1\\nE2\\nE3\\nE4\\nE5\\nPosition\\nEmbeddings\\nFigure 2: BERT input representation. The input embeddings are the sum of the token embeddings, the segmenta-\\ntion embeddings and the position embeddings.\\nThe NSP task is closely related to representation-\\nlearning objectives used in Jernite et al. (2017) and\\nLogeswaran and Lee (2018). However, in prior\\nwork, only sentence embeddings are transferred to\\ndown-stream tasks, where BERT transfers all pa-\\nrameters to initialize end-task model parameters.\\nPre-training data The pre-training procedure\\nlargely follows the existing literature on language\\nmodel pre-training. For the pre-training corpus we\\nuse the BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu et al.,\\n2015) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words).\\nFor Wikipedia we extract only the text passages\\nand ignore lists, tables, and headers. It is criti-\\ncal to use a document-level corpus rather than a\\nshufﬂed sentence-level corpus such as the Billion\\nWord Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013) in order to\\nextract long contiguous sequences.\\n3.2\\nFine-tuning BERT\\nFine-tuning is straightforward since the self-\\nattention mechanism in the Transformer al-\\nlows BERT to model many downstream tasks—\\nwhether they involve single text or text pairs—by\\nswapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.\\nFor applications involving text pairs, a common\\npattern is to independently encode text pairs be-\\nfore applying bidirectional cross attention, such\\nas Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT\\ninstead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify\\nthese two stages, as encoding a concatenated text\\npair with self-attention effectively includes bidi-\\nrectional cross attention between two sentences.\\nFor each task, we simply plug in the task-\\nspeciﬁc inputs and outputs into BERT and ﬁne-\\ntune all the parameters end-to-end.\\nAt the in-\\nput, sentence A and sentence B from pre-training\\nare analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphras-\\ning, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3)\\nquestion-passage pairs in question answering, and\\n(4) a degenerate text-∅pair in text classiﬁcation\\nor sequence tagging. At the output, the token rep-\\nresentations are fed into an output layer for token-\\nlevel tasks, such as sequence tagging or question\\nanswering, and the [CLS] representation is fed\\ninto an output layer for classiﬁcation, such as en-\\ntailment or sentiment analysis.\\nCompared to pre-training, ﬁne-tuning is rela-\\ntively inexpensive. All of the results in the pa-\\nper can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a sin-\\ngle Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting\\nfrom the exact same pre-trained model.7 We de-\\nscribe the task-speciﬁc details in the correspond-\\ning subsections of Section 4. More details can be\\nfound in Appendix A.5.\\n4\\nExperiments\\nIn this section, we present BERT ﬁne-tuning re-\\nsults on 11 NLP tasks.\\n4.1\\nGLUE\\nThe General Language Understanding Evaluation\\n(GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) is a col-\\nlection of diverse natural language understanding\\ntasks. Detailed descriptions of GLUE datasets are\\nincluded in Appendix B.1.\\nTo ﬁne-tune on GLUE, we represent the input\\nsequence (for single sentence or sentence pairs)\\nas described in Section 3, and use the ﬁnal hid-\\nden vector C ∈RH corresponding to the ﬁrst\\ninput token ([CLS]) as the aggregate representa-\\ntion. The only new parameters introduced during\\nﬁne-tuning are classiﬁcation layer weights W ∈\\nRK×H, where K is the number of labels. We com-\\npute a standard classiﬁcation loss with C and W,\\ni.e., log(softmax(CW T )).\\n7For example, the BERT SQuAD model can be trained in\\naround 30 minutes on a single Cloud TPU to achieve a Dev\\nF1 score of 91.0%.\\n8See (10) in https://gluebenchmark.com/faq.\\nSystem\\nMNLI-(m/mm)\\nQQP\\nQNLI\\nSST-2\\nCoLA\\nSTS-B\\nMRPC\\nRTE\\nAverage\\n392k\\n363k\\n108k\\n67k\\n8.5k\\n5.7k\\n3.5k\\n2.5k\\n-\\nPre-OpenAI SOTA\\n80.6/80.1\\n66.1\\n82.3\\n93.2\\n35.0\\n81.0\\n86.0\\n61.7\\n74.0\\nBiLSTM+ELMo+Attn\\n76.4/76.1\\n64.8\\n79.8\\n90.4\\n36.0\\n73.3\\n84.9\\n56.8\\n71.0\\nOpenAI GPT\\n82.1/81.4\\n70.3\\n87.4\\n91.3\\n45.4\\n80.0\\n82.3\\n56.0\\n75.1\\nBERTBASE\\n84.6/83.4\\n71.2\\n90.5\\n93.5\\n52.1\\n85.8\\n88.9\\n66.4\\n79.6\\nBERTLARGE\\n86.7/85.9\\n72.1\\n92.7\\n94.9\\n60.5\\n86.5\\n89.3\\n70.1\\n82.1\\nTable 1: GLUE Test results, scored by the evaluation server (https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard).\\nThe number below each task denotes the number of training examples. The “Average” column is slightly different\\nthan the ofﬁcial GLUE score, since we exclude the problematic WNLI set.8 BERT and OpenAI GPT are single-\\nmodel, single task. F1 scores are reported for QQP and MRPC, Spearman correlations are reported for STS-B, and\\naccuracy scores are reported for the other tasks. We exclude entries that use BERT as one of their components.\\nWe use a batch size of 32 and ﬁne-tune for 3\\nepochs over the data for all GLUE tasks. For each\\ntask, we selected the best ﬁne-tuning learning rate\\n(among 5e-5, 4e-5, 3e-5, and 2e-5) on the Dev set.\\nAdditionally, for BERTLARGE we found that ﬁne-\\ntuning was sometimes unstable on small datasets,\\nso we ran several random restarts and selected the\\nbest model on the Dev set. With random restarts,\\nwe use the same pre-trained checkpoint but per-\\nform different ﬁne-tuning data shufﬂing and clas-\\nsiﬁer layer initialization.9\\nResults are presented in Table 1.\\nBoth\\nBERTBASE and BERTLARGE outperform all sys-\\ntems on all tasks by a substantial margin, obtaining\\n4.5% and 7.0% respective average accuracy im-\\nprovement over the prior state of the art. Note that\\nBERTBASE and OpenAI GPT are nearly identical\\nin terms of model architecture apart from the at-\\ntention masking. For the largest and most widely\\nreported GLUE task, MNLI, BERT obtains a 4.6%\\nabsolute accuracy improvement. On the ofﬁcial\\nGLUE leaderboard10, BERTLARGE obtains a score\\nof 80.5, compared to OpenAI GPT, which obtains\\n72.8 as of the date of writing.\\nWe ﬁnd that BERTLARGE signiﬁcantly outper-\\nforms BERTBASE across all tasks, especially those\\nwith very little training data.

We only introduce a start vec-\\ntor S ∈RH and an end vector E ∈RH during\\nﬁne-tuning. The probability of word i being the\\nstart of the answer span is computed as a dot prod-\\nuct between Ti and S followed by a softmax over\\nall of the words in the paragraph: Pi =\\neS·Ti\\nP\\nj eS·Tj .\\nThe analogous formula is used for the end of the\\nanswer span. The score of a candidate span from\\nposition i to position j is deﬁned as S·Ti + E·Tj,\\nand the maximum scoring span where j ≥i is\\nused as a prediction. The training objective is the\\nsum of the log-likelihoods of the correct start and\\nend positions. We ﬁne-tune for 3 epochs with a\\nlearning rate of 5e-5 and a batch size of 32.\\nTable 2 shows top leaderboard entries as well\\nas results from top published systems (Seo et al.,\\n2017; Clark and Gardner, 2018; Peters et al.,\\n2018a; Hu et al., 2018).

The left-only constraint\\nwas also applied at ﬁne-tuning, because removing\\nit introduced a pre-train/ﬁne-tune mismatch that\\ndegraded downstream performance. Additionally,\\nthis model was pre-trained without the NSP task.\\nThis is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but\\nusing our larger training dataset, our input repre-\\nsentation, and our ﬁne-tuning scheme.\\nWe ﬁrst examine the impact brought by the NSP\\ntask.\\nIn Table 5, we show that removing NSP\\nhurts performance signiﬁcantly on QNLI, MNLI,\\nand SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact\\nof training bidirectional representations by com-\\nparing “No NSP” to “LTR & No NSP”. The LTR\\nmodel performs worse than the MLM model on all\\ntasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR\\nmodel will perform poorly at token predictions,\\nsince the token-level hidden states have no right-\\nside context. In order to make a good faith at-\\ntempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added\\na randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does\\nsigniﬁcantly improve results on SQuAD, but the\\nresults are still far worse than those of the pre-\\ntrained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts\\nperformance on the GLUE tasks.\\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to\\ntrain separate LTR and RTL models and represent\\neach token as the concatenation of the two mod-\\nels, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as\\nexpensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this\\nis non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since the RTL\\nmodel would not be able to condition the answer\\non the question; (c) this it is strictly less powerful\\nthan a deep bidirectional model, since it can use\\nboth left and right context at every layer.\\n5.2\\nEffect of Model Size\\nIn this section, we explore the effect of model size\\non ﬁne-tuning task accuracy. We trained a number\\nof BERT models with a differing number of layers,\\nhidden units, and attention heads, while otherwise\\nusing the same hyperparameters and training pro-\\ncedure as described previously.\\nResults on selected GLUE tasks are shown in\\nTable 6. In this table, we report the average Dev\\nSet accuracy from 5 random restarts of ﬁne-tuning.\\nWe can see that larger models lead to a strict ac-\\ncuracy improvement across all four datasets, even\\nfor MRPC which only has 3,600 labeled train-\\ning examples, and is substantially different from\\nthe pre-training tasks. It is also perhaps surpris-\\ning that we are able to achieve such signiﬁcant\\nimprovements on top of models which are al-\\nready quite large relative to the existing literature.\\nFor example, the largest Transformer explored in\\nVaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16)\\nwith 100M parameters for the encoder, and the\\nlargest Transformer we have found in the literature\\nis (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters\\n(Al-Rfou et al., 2018). By contrast, BERTBASE\\ncontains 110M parameters and BERTLARGE con-\\ntains 340M parameters.\\nIt has long been known that increasing the\\nmodel size will lead to continual improvements\\non large-scale tasks such as machine translation\\nand language modeling, which is demonstrated\\nby the LM perplexity of held-out training data\\nshown in Table 6.\\nHowever, we believe that\\nthis is the ﬁrst work to demonstrate convinc-\\ningly that scaling to extreme model sizes also\\nleads to large improvements on very small scale\\ntasks, provided that the model has been sufﬁ-\\nciently pre-trained. Peters et al. (2018b) presented\\nmixed results on the downstream task impact of\\nincreasing the pre-trained bi-LM size from two\\nto four layers and Melamud et al. (2016) men-\\ntioned in passing that increasing hidden dimen-\\nsion size from 200 to 600 helped, but increasing\\nfurther to 1,000 did not bring further improve-\\nments. Both of these prior works used a feature-\\nbased approach — we hypothesize that when the\\nmodel is ﬁne-tuned directly on the downstream\\ntasks and uses only a very small number of ran-\\ndomly initialized additional parameters, the task-\\nspeciﬁc models can beneﬁt from the larger, more\\nexpressive pre-trained representations even when\\ndownstream task data is very small.\\n5.3\\nFeature-based Approach with BERT\\nAll of the BERT results presented so far have used\\nthe ﬁne-tuning approach, where a simple classiﬁ-\\ncation layer is added to the pre-trained model, and\\nall parameters are jointly ﬁne-tuned on a down-\\nstream task. However, the feature-based approach,\\nwhere ﬁxed features are extracted from the pre-\\ntrained model, has certain advantages. First, not\\nall tasks can be easily represented by a Trans-\\nformer encoder architecture, and therefore require\\na task-speciﬁc model architecture to be added.\\nSecond, there are major computational beneﬁts\\nto pre-compute an expensive representation of the\\ntraining data once and then run many experiments\\nwith cheaper models on top of this representation.\\nIn this section, we compare the two approaches\\nby applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named\\nEntity Recognition (NER) task (Tjong Kim Sang\\nand De Meulder, 2003). In the input to BERT, we\\nuse a case-preserving WordPiece model, and we\\ninclude the maximal document context provided\\nby the data.

       "'BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for\\nLanguage Understanding\\nJacob Devlin\\nMing-Wei Chang\\nKenton Lee\\nKristina Toutanova\\nGoogle AI Language\\n{jacobdevlin,mingweichang,kentonl,kristout}@google.com\\nAbstract\\nWe introduce a new language representa-\\ntion model called BERT, which stands for\\nBidirectional Encoder Representations from\\nTransformers. Unlike recent language repre-\\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne-\\ntuned with just one additional output layer\\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\\nspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.\\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\\npowerful.\\nIt obtains new state-of-the-art re-\\nsults on eleven natural language processing\\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\\nbe effective for improving many natural language\\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\\nwhere models are required to produce ﬁne-grained\\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\\nThere are two existing strategies for apply-\\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\\nstream tasks: feature-based and ﬁne-tuning. The\\nfeature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters\\net al., 2018a), uses task-speciﬁc architectures that\\ninclude the pre-trained representations as addi-\\ntional features. The ﬁne-tuning approach, such as\\nthe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI\\nGPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal\\ntask-speciﬁc parameters, and is trained on the\\ndownstream tasks by simply ﬁne-tuning all pre-\\ntrained parameters. The two approaches share the\\nsame objective function during pre-training, where\\nthey use unidirectional language models to learn\\ngeneral language representations.\\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the\\npower of the pre-trained representations, espe-\\ncially for the ﬁne-tuning approaches.\\nThe ma-\\njor limitation is that standard language models are\\nunidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi-\\ntectures that can be used during pre-training. For\\nexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-\\nright architecture, where every token can only at-\\ntend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers\\nof the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re-\\nstrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,\\nand could be very harmful when applying ﬁne-\\ntuning based approaches to token-level tasks such\\nas question answering, where it is crucial to incor-\\nporate context from both directions.\\nIn this paper, we improve the ﬁne-tuning based\\napproaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional\\nEncoder\\nRepresentations\\nfrom\\nTransformers.\\nBERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi-\\nrectionality constraint by using a “masked lan-\\nguage model” (MLM) pre-training objective, in-\\nspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953).\\nThe\\nmasked language model randomly masks some of\\nthe tokens from the input, and the objective is to\\npredict the original vocabulary id of the masked\\narXiv:1810.04805v2  [cs.CL]  24 May 2019\\nword based only on its context.\\nUnlike left-to-\\nright language model pre-training, the MLM ob-\\njective enables the representation to fuse the left\\nand the right context, which allows us to pre-\\ntrain a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addi-\\ntion to the masked language model, we also use\\na “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pre-\\ntrains text-pair representations. The contributions\\nof our paper are as follows:\\n• We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional\\npre-training for language representations. Un-\\nlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec-\\ntional language models for pre-training, BERT\\nuses masked language models to enable pre-\\ntrained deep bidirectional representations. This\\nis also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which\\nuses a shallow concatenation of independently\\ntrained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\\n• We show that pre-trained representations reduce\\nthe need for many heavily-engineered task-\\nspeciﬁc architectures.

To pre-\\ntrain word embedding vectors, left-to-right lan-\\nguage modeling objectives have been used (Mnih\\nand Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to dis-\\ncriminate correct from incorrect words in left and\\nright context (Mikolov et al., 2013).\\nThese approaches have been generalized to\\ncoarser granularities, such as sentence embed-\\ndings (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran and Lee,\\n2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov,\\n2014).\\nTo train sentence representations, prior\\nwork has used objectives to rank candidate next\\nsentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and\\nLee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sen-\\ntence words given a representation of the previous\\nsentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising auto-\\nencoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016).\\nELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017,\\n2018a) generalize traditional word embedding re-\\nsearch along a different dimension. They extract\\ncontext-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a\\nright-to-left language model. The contextual rep-\\nresentation of each token is the concatenation of\\nthe left-to-right and right-to-left representations.\\nWhen integrating contextual word embeddings\\nwith existing task-speciﬁc architectures, ELMo\\nadvances the state of the art for several major NLP\\nbenchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including ques-\\ntion answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment\\nanalysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity\\nrecognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder,\\n2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning\\ncontextual representations through a task to pre-\\ndict a single word from both left and right context\\nusing LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is\\nfeature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus\\net al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used\\nto improve the robustness of text generation mod-\\nels.\\n2.2\\nUnsupervised Fine-tuning Approaches\\nAs with the feature-based approaches, the ﬁrst\\nworks in this direction only pre-trained word em-\\nbedding parameters from unlabeled text\\n(Col-\\nlobert and Weston, 2008).\\nMore recently, sentence or document encoders\\nwhich produce contextual token representations\\nhave been pre-trained from unlabeled text and\\nﬁne-tuned for a supervised downstream task (Dai\\nand Le, 2015; Howard and Ruder, 2018; Radford\\net al., 2018). The advantage of these approaches\\nis that few parameters need to be learned from\\nscratch.\\nAt least partly due to this advantage,\\nOpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018) achieved pre-\\nviously state-of-the-art results on many sentence-\\nlevel tasks from the GLUE benchmark (Wang\\net al., 2018a).\\nLeft-to-right language model-\\nBERT\\nBERT\\nE[CLS]\\nE1\\n E[SEP]\\n...\\nEN\\nE1’\\n...\\nEM’\\nC\\nT1\\nT[SEP]\\n...\\nTN\\nT1’\\n...\\nTM’\\n[CLS]\\nTok 1\\n [SEP]\\n...\\nTok N\\nTok 1\\n...\\nTokM\\nQuestion\\nParagraph\\nStart/End Span\\nBERT\\nE[CLS]\\nE1\\n E[SEP]\\n...\\nEN\\nE1’\\n...\\nEM’\\nC\\nT1\\nT[SEP]\\n...\\nTN\\nT1’\\n...\\nTM’\\n[CLS]\\nTok 1\\n [SEP]\\n...\\nTok N\\nTok 1\\n...\\nTokM\\nMasked Sentence A\\nMasked Sentence B\\nPre-training\\nFine-Tuning\\nNSP\\nMask LM\\nMask LM\\nUnlabeled Sentence A and B Pair \\nSQuAD\\nQuestion Answer Pair\\nNER\\nMNLI\\nFigure 1: Overall pre-training and ﬁne-tuning procedures for BERT. Apart from output layers, the same architec-\\ntures are used in both pre-training and ﬁne-tuning. The same pre-trained model parameters are used to initialize\\nmodels for different down-stream tasks. During ﬁne-tuning, all parameters are ﬁne-tuned. [CLS] is a special\\nsymbol added in front of every input example, and [SEP] is a special separator token (e.g. separating ques-\\ntions/answers).\\ning and auto-encoder objectives have been used\\nfor pre-training such models (Howard and Ruder,\\n2018; Radford et al., 2018; Dai and Le, 2015).\\n2.3\\nTransfer Learning from Supervised Data\\nThere has also been work showing effective trans-\\nfer from supervised tasks with large datasets, such\\nas natural language inference (Conneau et al.,\\n2017) and machine translation (McCann et al.,\\n2017). Computer vision research has also demon-\\nstrated the importance of transfer learning from\\nlarge pre-trained models, where an effective recipe\\nis to ﬁne-tune models pre-trained with Ima-\\ngeNet (Deng et al., 2009; Yosinski et al., 2014).\\n3\\nBERT\\nWe introduce BERT and its detailed implementa-\\ntion in this section. There are two steps in our\\nframework: pre-training and ﬁne-tuning.\\nDur-\\ning pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\\ndata over different pre-training tasks.\\nFor ﬁne-\\ntuning, the BERT model is ﬁrst initialized with\\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\\neters are ﬁne-tuned using labeled data from the\\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep-\\narate ﬁne-tuned models, even though they are ini-\\ntialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\\nas a running example for this section.\\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its uniﬁed ar-\\nchitecture across different tasks. There is mini-\\nmal difference between the pre-trained architec-\\nture and the ﬁnal downstream architecture.\\nModel Architecture\\nBERT’s model architec-\\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\\nscribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\\nthe tensor2tensor library.1 Because the use\\nof Transformers has become common and our im-\\nplementation is almost identical to the original,\\nwe will omit an exhaustive background descrip-\\ntion of the model architecture and refer readers to\\nVaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides\\nsuch as “The Annotated Transformer.”2\\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers\\n(i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as\\nH, and the number of self-attention heads as A.3\\nWe primarily report results on two model sizes:\\nBERTBASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param-\\neters=110M) and BERTLARGE (L=24, H=1024,\\nA=16, Total Parameters=340M).\\nBERTBASE was chosen to have the same model\\nsize as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes.\\nCritically, however, the BERT Transformer uses\\nbidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Trans-\\nformer uses constrained self-attention where every\\ntoken can only attend to context to its left.4\\n1https://github.com/tensorﬂow/tensor2tensor\\n2http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html\\n3In all cases we set the feed-forward/ﬁlter size to be 4H,\\ni.e., 3072 for the H = 768 and 4096 for the H = 1024.\\n4We note that in the literature the bidirectional Trans-\\nInput/Output Representations\\nTo make BERT\\nhandle a variety of down-stream tasks, our input\\nrepresentation is able to unambiguously represent\\nboth a single sentence and a pair of sentences\\n(e.g., ⟨Question, Answer ⟩) in one token sequence.\\nThroughout this work, a “sentence” can be an arbi-\\ntrary span of contiguous text, rather than an actual\\nlinguistic sentence. A “sequence” refers to the in-\\nput token sequence to BERT, which may be a sin-\\ngle sentence or two sentences packed together.\\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,\\n2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The ﬁrst\\ntoken of every sequence is always a special clas-\\nsiﬁcation token ([CLS]). The ﬁnal hidden state\\ncorresponding to this token is used as the ag-\\ngregate sequence representation for classiﬁcation\\ntasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a\\nsingle sequence. We differentiate the sentences in\\ntwo ways. First, we separate them with a special\\ntoken ([SEP]). Second, we add a learned embed-\\nding to every token indicating whether it belongs\\nto sentence A or sentence B. As shown in Figure 1,\\nwe denote input embedding as E, the ﬁnal hidden\\nvector of the special [CLS] token as C ∈RH,\\nand the ﬁnal hidden vector for the ith input token\\nas Ti ∈RH.\\nFor a given token, its input representation is\\nconstructed by summing the corresponding token,\\nsegment, and position embeddings. A visualiza-\\ntion of this construction can be seen in Figure 2.\\n3.1\\nPre-training BERT\\nUnlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al.\\n(2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or\\nright-to-left language models to pre-train BERT.\\nInstead, we pre-train BERT using two unsuper-\\nvised tasks, described in this section. This step\\nis presented in the left part of Figure 1.\\nTask #1: Masked LM\\nIntuitively, it is reason-\\nable to believe that a deep bidirectional model is\\nstrictly more powerful than either a left-to-right\\nmodel or the shallow concatenation of a left-to-\\nright and a right-to-left model.\\nUnfortunately,\\nstandard conditional language models can only be\\ntrained left-to-right or right-to-left, since bidirec-\\ntional conditioning would allow each word to in-\\ndirectly “see itself”, and the model could trivially\\npredict the target word in a multi-layered context.\\nformer is often referred to as a “Transformer encoder” while\\nthe left-context-only version is referred to as a “Transformer\\ndecoder” since it can be used for text generation.\\nIn order to train a deep bidirectional representa-\\ntion, we simply mask some percentage of the input\\ntokens at random, and then predict those masked\\ntokens. We refer to this procedure as a “masked\\nLM” (MLM), although it is often referred to as a\\nCloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this\\ncase, the ﬁnal hidden vectors corresponding to the\\nmask tokens are fed into an output softmax over\\nthe vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our\\nexperiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece to-\\nkens in each sequence at random. In contrast to\\ndenoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we\\nonly predict the masked words rather than recon-\\nstructing the entire input.\\nAlthough this allows us to obtain a bidirec-\\ntional pre-trained model, a downside is that we\\nare creating a mismatch between pre-training and\\nﬁne-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not ap-\\npear during ﬁne-tuning. To mitigate this, we do\\nnot always replace “masked” words with the ac-\\ntual [MASK] token. The training data generator\\nchooses 15% of the token positions at random for\\nprediction. If the i-th token is chosen, we replace\\nthe i-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of\\nthe time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3)\\nthe unchanged i-th token 10% of the time. Then,\\nTi will be used to predict the original token with\\ncross entropy loss. We compare variations of this\\nprocedure in Appendix C.2.\\nTask #2:\\nNext Sentence Prediction (NSP)\\nMany important downstream tasks such as Ques-\\ntion Answering (QA) and Natural Language Infer-\\nence (NLI) are based on understanding the rela-\\ntionship between two sentences, which is not di-\\nrectly captured by language modeling. In order\\nto train a model that understands sentence rela-\\ntionships, we pre-train for a binarized next sen-\\ntence prediction task that can be trivially gener-\\nated from any monolingual corpus. Speciﬁcally,\\nwhen choosing the sentences A and B for each pre-\\ntraining example, 50% of the time B is the actual\\nnext sentence that follows A (labeled as IsNext),\\nand 50% of the time it is a random sentence from\\nthe corpus (labeled as NotNext).\\nAs we show\\nin Figure 1, C is used for next sentence predic-\\ntion (NSP).5 Despite its simplicity, we demon-\\nstrate in Section 5.1 that pre-training towards this\\ntask is very beneﬁcial to both QA and NLI. 6\\n5The ﬁnal model achieves 97%-98% accuracy on NSP.\\n6The vector C is not a meaningful sentence representation\\nwithout ﬁne-tuning, since it was trained with NSP.\\n[CLS]\\nhe\\nlikes\\nplay\\n##ing\\n[SEP]\\nmy\\ndog\\nis\\ncute\\n[SEP]\\nInput\\nE[CLS]\\nEhe\\nElikes\\nEplay\\nE##ing\\nE[SEP]\\nEmy\\nEdog\\nEis\\nEcute\\nE[SEP]\\nToken\\nEmbeddings\\nEA\\nEB\\nEB\\nEB\\nEB\\nEB\\nEA\\nEA\\nEA\\nEA\\nEA\\nSegment\\nEmbeddings\\nE0\\nE6\\nE7\\nE8\\nE9\\nE10\\nE1\\nE2\\nE3\\nE4\\nE5\\nPosition\\nEmbeddings\\nFigure 2: BERT input representation. The input embeddings are the sum of the token embeddings, the segmenta-\\ntion embeddings and the position embeddings.\\nThe NSP task is closely related to representation-\\nlearning objectives used in Jernite et al. (2017) and\\nLogeswaran and Lee (2018). However, in prior\\nwork, only sentence embeddings are transferred to\\ndown-stream tasks, where BERT transfers all pa-\\nrameters to initialize end-task model parameters.\\nPre-training data The pre-training procedure\\nlargely follows the existing literature on language\\nmodel pre-training. For the pre-training corpus we\\nuse the BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu et al.,\\n2015) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words).\\nFor Wikipedia we extract only the text passages\\nand ignore lists, tables, and headers. It is criti-\\ncal to use a document-level corpus rather than a\\nshufﬂed sentence-level corpus such as the Billion\\nWord Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013) in order to\\nextract long contiguous sequences.\\n3.2\\nFine-tuning BERT\\nFine-tuning is straightforward since the self-\\nattention mechanism in the Transformer al-\\nlows BERT to model many downstream tasks—\\nwhether they involve single text or text pairs—by\\nswapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.\\nFor applications involving text pairs, a common\\npattern is to independently encode text pairs be-\\nfore applying bidirectional cross attention, such\\nas Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT\\ninstead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify\\nthese two stages, as encoding a concatenated text\\npair with self-attention effectively includes bidi-\\nrectional cross attention between two sentences.\\nFor each task, we simply plug in the task-\\nspeciﬁc inputs and outputs into BERT and ﬁne-\\ntune all the parameters end-to-end.\\nAt the in-\\nput, sentence A and sentence B from pre-training\\nare analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphras-\\ning, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3)\\nquestion-passage pairs in question answering, and\\n(4) a degenerate text-∅pair in text classiﬁcation\\nor sequence tagging. At the output, the token rep-\\nresentations are fed into an output layer for token-\\nlevel tasks, such as sequence tagging or question\\nanswering, and the [CLS] representation is fed\\ninto an output layer for classiﬁcation, such as en-\\ntailment or sentiment analysis.\\nCompared to pre-training, ﬁne-tuning is rela-\\ntively inexpensive. All of the results in the pa-\\nper can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a sin-\\ngle Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting\\nfrom the exact same pre-trained model.7 We de-\\nscribe the task-speciﬁc details in the correspond-\\ning subsections of Section 4. More details can be\\nfound in Appendix A.5.\\n4\\nExperiments\\nIn this section, we present BERT ﬁne-tuning re-\\nsults on 11 NLP tasks.\\n4.1\\nGLUE\\nThe General Language Understanding Evaluation\\n(GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) is a col-\\nlection of diverse natural language understanding\\ntasks. Detailed descriptions of GLUE datasets are\\nincluded in Appendix B.1.\\nTo ﬁne-tune on GLUE, we represent the input\\nsequence (for single sentence or sentence pairs)\\nas described in Section 3, and use the ﬁnal hid-\\nden vector C ∈RH corresponding to the ﬁrst\\ninput token ([CLS]) as the aggregate representa-\\ntion. The only new parameters introduced during\\nﬁne-tuning are classiﬁcation layer weights W ∈\\nRK×H, where K is the number of labels. We com-\\npute a standard classiﬁcation loss with C and W,\\ni.e., log(softmax(CW T )).\\n7For example, the BERT SQuAD model can be trained in\\naround 30 minutes on a single Cloud TPU to achieve a Dev\\nF1 score of 91.0%.\\n8See (10) in https://gluebenchmark.com/faq.\\nSystem\\nMNLI-(m/mm)\\nQQP\\nQNLI\\nSST-2\\nCoLA\\nSTS-B\\nMRPC\\nRTE\\nAverage\\n392k\\n363k\\n108k\\n67k\\n8.5k\\n5.7k\\n3.5k\\n2.5k\\n-\\nPre-OpenAI SOTA\\n80.6/80.1\\n66.1\\n82.3\\n93.2\\n35.0\\n81.0\\n86.0\\n61.7\\n74.0\\nBiLSTM+ELMo+Attn\\n76.4/76.1\\n64.8\\n79.8\\n90.4\\n36.0\\n73.3\\n84.9\\n56.8\\n71.0\\nOpenAI GPT\\n82.1/81.4\\n70.3\\n87.4\\n91.3\\n45.4\\n80.0\\n82.3\\n56.0\\n75.1\\nBERTBASE\\n84.6/83.4\\n71.2\\n90.5\\n93.5\\n52.1\\n85.8\\n88.9\\n66.4\\n79.6\\nBERTLARGE\\n86.7/85.9\\n72.1\\n92.7\\n94.9\\n60.5\\n86.5\\n89.3\\n70.1\\n82.1\\nTable 1: GLUE Test results, scored by the evaluation server (https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard).\\nThe number below each task denotes the number of training examples. The “Average” column is slightly different\\nthan the ofﬁcial GLUE score, since we exclude the problematic WNLI set.8 BERT and OpenAI GPT are single-\\nmodel, single task. F1 scores are reported for QQP and MRPC, Spearman correlations are reported for STS-B, and\\naccuracy scores are reported for the other tasks. We exclude entries that use BERT as one of their components.\\nWe use a batch size of 32 and ﬁne-tune for 3\\nepochs over the data for all GLUE tasks. For each\\ntask, we selected the best ﬁne-tuning learning rate\\n(among 5e-5, 4e-5, 3e-5, and 2e-5) on the Dev set.\\nAdditionally, for BERTLARGE we found that ﬁne-\\ntuning was sometimes unstable on small datasets,\\nso we ran several random restarts and selected the\\nbest model on the Dev set. With random restarts,\\nwe use the same pre-trained checkpoint but per-\\nform different ﬁne-tuning data shufﬂing and clas-\\nsiﬁer layer initialization.9\\nResults are presented in Table 1.\\nBoth\\nBERTBASE and BERTLARGE outperform all sys-\\ntems on all tasks by a substantial margin, obtaining\\n4.5% and 7.0% respective average accuracy im-\\nprovement over the prior state of the art. Note that\\nBERTBASE and OpenAI GPT are nearly identical\\nin terms of model architecture apart from the at-\\ntention masking. For the largest and most widely\\nreported GLUE task, MNLI, BERT obtains a 4.6%\\nabsolute accuracy improvement. On the ofﬁcial\\nGLUE leaderboard10, BERTLARGE obtains a score\\nof 80.5, compared to OpenAI GPT, which obtains\\n72.8 as of the date of writing.\\nWe ﬁnd that BERTLARGE signiﬁcantly outper-\\nforms BERTBASE across all tasks, especially those\\nwith very little training data. The effect of model\\nsize is explored more thoroughly in Section 5.2.\\n4.2\\nSQuAD v1.1\\nThe\\nStanford\\nQuestion\\nAnswering\\nDataset\\n(SQuAD v1.1) is a collection of 100k crowd-\\nsourced question/answer pairs (Rajpurkar et al.,\\n2016).\\nGiven a question and a passage from\\n9The GLUE data set distribution does not include the Test\\nlabels, and we only made a single GLUE evaluation server\\nsubmission for each of BERTBASE and BERTLARGE.\\n10https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard\\nWikipedia containing the answer, the task is to\\npredict the answer text span in the passage.\\nAs shown in Figure 1, in the question answer-\\ning task, we represent the input question and pas-\\nsage as a single packed sequence, with the ques-\\ntion using the A embedding and the passage using\\nthe B embedding. We only introduce a start vec-\\ntor S ∈RH and an end vector E ∈RH during\\nﬁne-tuning. The probability of word i being the\\nstart of the answer span is computed as a dot prod-\\nuct between Ti and S followed by a softmax over\\nall of the words in the paragraph: Pi =\\neS·Ti\\nP\\nj eS·Tj .\\nThe analogous formula is used for the end of the\\nanswer span. The score of a candidate span from\\nposition i to position j is deﬁned as S·Ti + E·Tj,\\nand the maximum scoring span where j ≥i is\\nused as a prediction. The training objective is the\\nsum of the log-likelihoods of the correct start and\\nend positions. We ﬁne-tune for 3 epochs with a\\nlearning rate of 5e-5 and a batch size of 32.\\nTable 2 shows top leaderboard entries as well\\nas results from top published systems (Seo et al.,\\n2017; Clark and Gardner, 2018; Peters et al.,\\n2018a; Hu et al., 2018).

The left-only constraint\\nwas also applied at ﬁne-tuning, because removing\\nit introduced a pre-train/ﬁne-tune mismatch that\\ndegraded downstream performance. Additionally,\\nthis model was pre-trained without the NSP task.\\nThis is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but\\nusing our larger training dataset, our input repre-\\nsentation, and our ﬁne-tuning scheme.\\nWe ﬁrst examine the impact brought by the NSP\\ntask.\\nIn Table 5, we show that removing NSP\\nhurts performance signiﬁcantly on QNLI, MNLI,\\nand SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact\\nof training bidirectional representations by com-\\nparing “No NSP” to “LTR & No NSP”. The LTR\\nmodel performs worse than the MLM model on all\\ntasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR\\nmodel will perform poorly at token predictions,\\nsince the token-level hidden states have no right-\\nside context. In order to make a good faith at-\\ntempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added\\na randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does\\nsigniﬁcantly improve results on SQuAD, but the\\nresults are still far worse than those of the pre-\\ntrained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts\\nperformance on the GLUE tasks.\\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to\\ntrain separate LTR and RTL models and represent\\neach token as the concatenation of the two mod-\\nels, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as\\nexpensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this\\nis non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since the RTL\\nmodel would not be able to condition the answer\\non the question; (c) this it is strictly less powerful\\nthan a deep bidirectional model, since it can use\\nboth left and right context at every layer.\\n5.2\\nEffect of Model Size\\nIn this section, we explore the effect of model size\\non ﬁne-tuning task accuracy. We trained a number\\nof BERT models with a differing number of layers,\\nhidden units, and attention heads, while otherwise\\nusing the same hyperparameters and training pro-\\ncedure as described previously.\\nResults on selected GLUE tasks are shown in\\nTable 6. In this table, we report the average Dev\\nSet accuracy from 5 random restarts of ﬁne-tuning.\\nWe can see that larger models lead to a strict ac-\\ncuracy improvement across all four datasets, even\\nfor MRPC which only has 3,600 labeled train-\\ning examples, and is substantially different from\\nthe pre-training tasks. It is also perhaps surpris-\\ning that we are able to achieve such signiﬁcant\\nimprovements on top of models which are al-\\nready quite large relative to the existing literature.\\nFor example, the largest Transformer explored in\\nVaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16)\\nwith 100M parameters for the encoder, and the\\nlargest Transformer we have found in the literature\\nis (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters\\n(Al-Rfou et al., 2018). By contrast, BERTBASE\\ncontains 110M parameters and BERTLARGE con-\\ntains 340M parameters.\\nIt has long been known that increasing the\\nmodel size will lead to continual improvements\\non large-scale tasks such as machine translation\\nand language modeling, which is demonstrated\\nby the LM perplexity of held-out training data\\nshown in Table 6.\\nHowever, we believe that\\nthis is the ﬁrst work to demonstrate convinc-\\ningly that scaling to extreme model sizes also\\nleads to large improvements on very small scale\\ntasks, provided that the model has been sufﬁ-\\nciently pre-trained. Peters et al. (2018b) presented\\nmixed results on the downstream task impact of\\nincreasing the pre-trained bi-LM size from two\\nto four layers and Melamud et al. (2016) men-\\ntioned in passing that increasing hidden dimen-\\nsion size from 200 to 600 helped, but increasing\\nfurther to 1,000 did not bring further improve-\\nments. Both of these prior works used a feature-\\nbased approach — we hypothesize that when the\\nmodel is ﬁne-tuned directly on the downstream\\ntasks and uses only a very small number of ran-\\ndomly initialized additional parameters, the task-\\nspeciﬁc models can beneﬁt from the larger, more\\nexpressive pre-trained representations even when\\ndownstream task data is very small.\\n5.3\\nFeature-based Approach with BERT\\nAll of the BERT results presented so far have used\\nthe ﬁne-tuning approach, where a simple classiﬁ-\\ncation layer is added to the pre-trained model, and\\nall parameters are jointly ﬁne-tuned on a down-\\nstream task. However, the feature-based approach,\\nwhere ﬁxed features are extracted from the pre-\\ntrained model, has certain advantages. First, not\\nall tasks can be easily represented by a Trans-\\nformer encoder architecture, and therefore require\\na task-speciﬁc model architecture to be added.\\nSecond, there are major computational beneﬁts\\nto pre-compute an expensive representation of the\\ntraining data once and then run many experiments\\nwith cheaper models on top of this representation.\\nIn this section, we compare the two approaches\\nby applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named\\nEntity Recognition (NER) task (Tjong Kim Sang\\nand De Meulder, 2003). In the input to BERT, we\\nuse a case-preserving WordPiece model, and we\\ninclude the maximal document context provided\\nby the data.

We use the representation of\\nthe ﬁrst sub-token as the input to the token-level\\nclassiﬁer over the NER label set.\\nTo ablate the ﬁne-tuning approach, we apply the\\nfeature-based approach by extracting the activa-\\ntions from one or more layers without ﬁne-tuning\\nany parameters of BERT.

In\\nparticular, these results enable even low-resource\\ntasks to beneﬁt from deep unidirectional architec-\\ntures.

At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2\\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1\\nEncoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:'),\n",

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be\\nsuperior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly\\nless time to train.
